# Stock Analysis - Refactored for Faster Runtime

#### Overview of Project
The customer liked the original stock analysis workbook provided with the ability to click a button and be able to analyze an entire dataset.  The customer now
wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years.  It needs to be determined if the code written for the original stock analysis project can be refactored to cover a much larger dataset in regards to execution runtime. 

### Purpose
The customer wants to expand the research to cover the entire stock market.  Prior coding was sufficient to execute the smaller dataset for runtime-purposes, but
with a much larger dataset code refactoring is being performed to improve execution efficiency.
