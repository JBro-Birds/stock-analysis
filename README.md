# Stock Analysis - Refactored for Faster Runtime

## Overview of Project
The customer liked the original stock analysis workbook provided with the front-end ability to click a button in order to produce an analysis of an entire dataset. 
The customer now wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years.  This project is to determine if the code written for the
original stock analysis project can be refactored to run a much larger dataset more efficiently in regards to execution runtime. 

### Purpose
The customer wants to expand the research to cover the entire stock market.  Prior coding was sufficient to execute the smaller dataset for runtime-purposes, but
with a much larger dataset code refactoring needs to be performed to determine if the executed runtime can be improved.  If refactoring is successful the runtime will run faster and the customer will remain happy.
